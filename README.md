# SQL
A bunch of random queries, challenges, and databases using Postgresql/PgAdmin
- I took a Postegresql course back in September 2023 as I wanted to learn about relational database systems and how to query databases etc.
- If anything you find here happens to be incorrect (whether there are indentation problems or things are not making sense), please let me know!
